#This is a Terraform data source from the google provider that fetches information about the currently authenticated Google Cloud client used by Terraform. It's especially useful when you need details like:
#Project,Region/Zone,Access token and Account being used
#This is useful in dynamic environments where you want Terraform to adapt to the current GCP configuration((for example, based on gcloud auth login).
